# (some) Advent of Code Solutions 2022 in roc-lang

I couldn't get the roc compiler to run on my intel mac running Ventura, so I used docker.

Get into the dev env with

```fish
docker compose run -rm app
```

Then you can run the roc apps by `cd`ing into the day directory and running `roc dev main.roc`.
